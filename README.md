# TekDisplayDriver

# What
Tektronix vector displays were used 40 years ago:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tektronix_4010

# Why? 
Because there are still many Tektronix emulations around, it could be useful, even today, to have a driver for it

# How?

On Windows you can use Teraterm.
In Teraterm, you can enable the TEk-emulation:
setup->terminal->auto switch [VT<->TEK]
